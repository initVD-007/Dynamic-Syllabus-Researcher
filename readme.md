# Dynamic Syllabus Researcher (DSR) 🎓🤖

### Subtitle: An Autonomous Multi-Agent NLP Framework for Curriculum Modernization

## 🔬 Research Overview
In the fast-evolving field of AI/ML, academic syllabi become obsolete within months. **DSR** is a research-driven tool that utilizes a Multi-Agent system to bridge the gap between static university teaching and 2026 industry requirements.

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Automated NER Extraction:** Extracts core learning objectives from university PDFs.
- **Real-time Trend Alignment:** Scrapes 2026 research papers and GitHub repos to find "Knowledge Gaps."
- **Agentic Reasoning:** Uses a "Planner-Critic" loop to suggest syllabus updates without human intervention.

## 📊 Why this is not a Chatbot
Unlike ChatGPT, DSR is **Proactive**. It doesn't wait for a prompt; it monitors data streams and alerts the educator when a topic is no longer relevant.
